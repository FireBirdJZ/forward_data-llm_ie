Prompt: Understanding the Task: The task involves creating a object for each professor using text data. Each object should 
include 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'.

Analyzing the Text: The text contains information about professors. Each professor's details are in a list format, where 
the first element is the name, the second the position (if present), and the third (if present) is research interests.

Handling Missing Information: In cases where information about a professor's research interests is missing, the value 
should be replaced with 'null'.

First: We need to find the name of the professor inside the list. we should use the key name and output the professors with it.
First Example:
- For 'Brian P. Bailey', the object will be: 
    name: Brian P. Bailey

- For 'Michael Bailey', the object will be:
    name: "Michael Bailey

Please show your thought process of doing this first step.

Second: We need to find the Professors's position inside of th4 list using the key position.
Second Example:
- For 'Brian P. Bailey', the object will be: 
    name: Brian P. Bailey
    position: Professor

- For 'Michael Bailey', the object will be:
    name: "Michael Bailey
    position: "Adjunct Professor
   
Please show your thought process of doing this second step.

Creating Individual Objects:
- For each professor, create a dictionary with the keys name, position, and research_interests.
- If any of these elements are missing, use 'null' as the value for that key.

Building the Final Output:
- Combine these individual dictionaries into a single list.
- This list represents the entire output, without wrapping it inside another object like "professors".

Final Examples
- For 'Brian P. Bailey', the object will be: 
    name: Brian P. Bailey
    position: Professor
    research_interests: null

- For 'Michael Bailey', the object will be:
    name: "Michael Bailey
    position: "Adjunct Professor
    research_interests: null

Text of where the Professor List is: 
['Jimeng  Sun', None, 'Professor']
['Hari  Sundaram', None, 'Professor']
['Ruby Tahboub', None, 'Teaching Assistant Professor']"

GPT3.5 Response:
First Step Thought Process:
To find the name of the professor inside the list, we can access the first element of each sublist, as mentioned in the task description.

1. Initialize an empty list to store the objects for each professor.
2. Iterate through each sublist in the given text data.
3. For each sublist, extract the first element (name) and store it in a variable.
4. Create a dictionary object with the key 'name' and assign the extracted name as its value.
5. Append the created dictionary object to the list of professor objects.

Second Step Thought Process:
To find the professor's position inside the list, we can access the second element of each sublist, as mentioned in the task description.

1. While iterating through each sublist in the given text data, after extracting the name, check if there is a second element present.
2. If a second element is present, extract it (position) and store it in a variable.
3. Update the previously created dictionary object by adding a new key-value pair, where the key is 'position' and the value is the extracted position.

Creating Individual Objects:

1. After extracting the name and, if present, position, check if there is a third element present in the sublist.
2. If a third element is present, extract it (research interests) and store it in a variable.
3. Update the previously created dictionary object by adding a new key-value pair, where the key is 'research_interests' and the value is the extracted research interests.
4. If a third element is not present, set the value for the key 'research_interests' as 'null'.

Building the Final Output:

1. After creating the dictionary objects for each professor, combine them into a single list.
2. This list represents the entire output with the required information for each professor.

Prompt: Understanding the Task: The task involves creating JSON objects for each professor using text data. Each object should 
include 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'.

Analyzing the Text: The text contains information about professors. Each professor's details are in a list format, where 
the first element is the name, the second the position, and the third (if present) is research interests.

Handling Missing Information: In cases where information about a professor's research interests is missing, the value 
should be replaced with 'null'.

Creating Individual JSON Objects:
- For each professor, create a dictionary with the keys 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'.
- If any of these elements are missing, use 'null' as the value for that key.

Building the Final JSON Output:
- Combine these individual dictionaries into a single list.
- This list represents the entire JSON output, without wrapping it inside another object like "professors".

Examples:
- For 'Brian P. Bailey', the JSON object will be: 
{
    "name": "Brian P. Bailey",
    "position": "Professor",
    "research_interests": null
}
- For 'Michael Bailey', the JSON object will be:
{
    "name": "Michael Bailey",
    "position": "Adjunct Professor",
    "research_interests": null
}
- And so on for other professors in the list.

Final Output: The final output should be a JSON array consisting of these JSON objects. Ensure there is no additional 
nesting under a "professors" key to avoid errors in data processing.

Note on JSON Structure: It is crucial to maintain correct JSON syntax and structure, ensuring that no additional or 
unwarranted layers (like a "professors" key) are added to the final JSON output.

Given ['Brian P. Bailey', None, 'Professor'], the 'name' key will be "Brian P. Bailey".
Step 2: Extracting Positions

Extract the second element for the position, using 'null' if it is missing.
Example:
Given ['Brian P. Bailey', None, 'Professor'], the 'position' key will be 'Professor'.
Step 3: Extracting Research Interests

Extract the third element for research interests, using 'null' if it is missing.
Example:
Given ['Brian P. Bailey', None, 'Professor'], the 'research_interests' key will be 'null' since the research interests are missing.
Creating Individual JSON Objects:

For each professor, create a JSON object (dictionary in Python) with the keys 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'.
Ensure to replace missing elements with 'null'.
Building the Final JSON Output:

Combine these individual JSON objects into a single JSON array.
The final output should be a clean JSON array without any additional nesting.
Final Examples:

For 'Brian P. Bailey', the JSON object will be:
{
    "name": "Brian P. Bailey",
    "position": Professor,
    "research_interests": "null"

Understanding the Task:
The task is to create JSON objects for each professor using the provided text data. Each JSON object should include keys for 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'.

Analyzing the Text:
The provided text data contains details about professors in list format. The first element is the professor's name, the second element (if present) is their position, and the third element (if present) is their research interests.

Handling Missing Information:
If any of these elements are missing (position or research interests), the value should be set to 'null'.

Watch Out For:
pronouns such as he, they, or her. Don't add these anywhere to the JSON object.

Step-by-Step Process with Examples:

Step 1: Extracting Names

Extract the first element from each list for the name.
Example:
Given ['Devin H. Bailey', None, 'Associate Professor'], the 'name' key will be "Devin H. Bailey".
Step 2: Extracting Positions

Extract the second element for the position, using 'null' if it is missing.
Example:
Given ['Devin H. Bailey', None, 'Associate Professor'], the 'position' key will be 'Associate Professor'.
Step 3: Extracting Research Interests

Extract the third element for research interests, using 'null' if it is missing.
Example:
Given ['Devin H. Bailey', None, 'Associate Professor'], the 'research_interests' key will be 'null' since the research interests are missing.
Creating Individual JSON Objects:

For each professor, create a JSON object (dictionary in Python) with the keys 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'.
Ensure to replace missing elements with 'null'.
Building the Final JSON Output:

Combine these individual JSON objects into a single JSON array.
The final output should be a clean JSON array without any additional nesting.
Final Example:

For 'Devin H. Bailey', the JSON object will be:
{
    "name": "Devin H. Bailey",
    "position": Associate Professor,
    "research_interests": "null"
}
Continue this process for Rest of Professors, following the same steps. Don't write the Final Example JSON Object.
