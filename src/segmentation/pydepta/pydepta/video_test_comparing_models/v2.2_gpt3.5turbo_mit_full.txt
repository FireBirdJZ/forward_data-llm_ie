The task is to create JSON objects for each professor using the provided text data. The JSON objects should include the keys 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'. If any of these elements are missing, the value should be set to 'null'. 

To create the JSON objects, follow these steps:

Step 1: Extract the first element from each list for the name. 
Example: For ['Devin H. Bailey', None, 'Associate Professor'], the 'name' key will be "Devin H. Bailey".

Step 2: Extract the second element for the position, using 'null' if it is missing.
Example: For ['Devin H. Bailey', None, 'Associate Professor'], the 'position' key will be 'Associate Professor'.

Step 3: Extract the third element for research interests, using 'null' if it is missing. 
Example: For ['Devin H. Bailey', None, 'Associate Professor'], the 'research_interests' key will be 'null' since the research interests are missing.

Create individual JSON objects for each professor using the keys 'name', 'position', and 'research_interests'. Replace missing elements with 'null'.

Combine these individual JSON objects into a single JSON array as the final output.

Follow this process for all the professors.
